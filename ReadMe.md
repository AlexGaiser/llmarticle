# LLM Article Project

## Disclaimer

This project was almost entirely created by an LLM. I am not responsible for it's relatively low quality and poor extensibility. Take a look around and you will probably notice some interesting artifacts.

## Description

This project is a web application that allows users to create and manage articles using a large language model (LLM). The application is built using React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend.
